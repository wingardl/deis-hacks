# Waltham Community Routes

This project was created for 2019 DeisHacks in collaboration with the Waltham Partnership for Youth

Waltham Community Routes is a web app that allows community members to share their
local knowledge of best/safest routes via an interactive map where users can draw their paths that may
not be shown on a typical routing application. There is integration with the live MBTA twitter feed and official
form to submit maintenance requests (e.g. potholes) to the city of Waltham.
